This section contains a library of known substances and their reflectance/fluorescence spectrums

McNamara-Boswell contains the emission, and excitation spectrums of various materials dissolved in specific solvents

LifeTechnologies contains the same thing as the McNamara-Boswell dataset

In both datasets the files contains the wavelengths at which the measurements are taken at. A normalized emission spectrum and a normalized excitation spectrum. Note that these values are only accurate to a scale. In order to do theoretical calculations I would need a scaling factor for whatever
