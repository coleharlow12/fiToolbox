Unmixing Coral Fluorescence Emission spectra and predicting new spectra under different excitation conditions :

This paper was about an "unmixing algorithm" which sought to isolate the contributions of individual fluorescent pigments. This was done by measuring the excitation and emission spectrum of individual pigments and then using a least squares algorithm to break the measured spectrum into components of basis spectrums derived from the response of individual proteins

Key Takeaways:
- This paper gave names of equipment to measure emission spectrum of corals (possibly also excitation)
- This paper notes that certain pigments can couple together if their excitation and emission spectrums overlap, making this decomposition incorrect in such cases.
- This paper notes that emission and excitation spectrums remain at a constant relative wavelength to each other but they spectrums can shift their absolute value by as much as 20 nm
- Also has some example normalized emission spectrums of different coral pigments


Separating the fluorescence and reflectance components of coral spectra:

Developed a method to separate the contributions of reflectance and fluorescence in coral spectrums. This new method was developed to cut down on the number of measurements divers are required to take underwater and should yield more accurate results.

Key Takeaways: 
- This paper describes methods and instrumentation used to measure coral reflectance, emission, and excitation spectra
- This paper gives a good understanding of how fluorescence impacts measured coral spectrums
- This paper gives example emission spectra and some measured exitance spectra. These spectrums though are given in arbitrary units which makes any calculations difficult

Contribution of fluorescence to the spectral signature and perceived color of corals

Studied the impact of different fluorescence pigments on the overall coloration of coral. Simulated the impact that different coral depths would have on the spectrum of coral at the surface (essentially accounting for different amounts of water attenuation)
- Develops a practical definition of in-situ Quantum Efficiency
- Quotes that coral pigment quantum efficiency is between 3 to 5% for p486 10 to 12% for p515 and 8 to 10% for p575
- Shows that in most cases it is valid to assume that the addition of fluorescence components to the exitance from the coral does not impact the baseline reflectance significantly. This assumption will be used for the simulations.
